üöÄ Reth Node Builder v0.1 - Reth + Lighthouse + Moonstruct
```

> Why? Because ‚ò†Ô∏è docker

### What?

- Simplifies the process of setting up a Reth node on a Linux system via a shell script.
- This script can:
  - Install: Reth, Lighthouse and Moonstruct.
  - Generate a JWT
  - Run moonsnap to download a snapshot and set up the Reth and Lighthouse daemon services.
  - Produce systemd services to run reth and lighthouse

## Start Here

> Note: Specific to Hetzner dedicated servers

### 0. Install the Repo

1. ssh into your instance
2. Install this repo
3. (optional) to use moonsnap `-m` place your `MOONSNAP_KEY` in the `.env` from [here](https://github.com/crebsy/moonsnap-downloadoor)
4. `cd reth-node-builder`
5. `chmod +x ./setup.sh`
6. Choose 1a or 1b

### 1a. Setup a full Node

`setup.sh -n <network> -m`

- Installs a Reth Node, Lighthouse CL Node and sets up system d services with moonsnap

### 1b.Setup a Full Node with an ExEx

`setup.sh -s https://github.com/AlignNetwork/blobster.git -m`

- `-s` option is the source of the reth, if you follow the [Reth examples repo](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth-exex-examples/tree/main) it runs reth with your exex so it will configure the correct options for the systemd

### 2. Starting Node

If the script ran successfully you should be able to run:

- `systemctl start reth-mainnet` - Start Reth Client
- `systemctl start lighthouse-mainnet` - Start Lighthouse Client
- `journalctl -u reth-mainnet -f` - Logs of Reth
- `journalctl -u lighthouse-mainnet -f`- Logs of Lighthouse

### Directory Structure:

The setup exists in reth-node-setup and the node data exists in /root/node

```
Directory Structure:
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ node
‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ reth (reth data)
‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ secret (jwt secret)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ reth-node-setup (this script home directory)
‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ node-sources (reth and lighthouse source code)
‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ services (your network services. This is where you put the run commands (reth node etc))
‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .env (Moonsnap environment file)
‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ node_setup.sh (this script)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...

```

### Hosting / ssh

I tested this stack on:

1. Holesky: Hetzner AX42 for Holesky SSD: 2x512 Software: Raid1

> [!TIP]
> I selected Ubunutu 22 base on creation of instance, also added an ssh key with `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "<Email>"`

### Notes:

1. On Hetzner I had interactive menus popup to restart defaults, I proceeded forwarded with them, I haven't looked into what exactly they are but it did not seem to affect the server.
2. Moonsnap saves a lot of time (only took around 2.5 hrs)
