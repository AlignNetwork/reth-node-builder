# Reth Node Config

[![Telegram Chat][tg-badge]][tg-url]

This repo offers a shell script to deploy a **Reth node as well as Reth Exex's**

üöÄ Reth Node Builder v0.1 - Reth + Lighthouse + Moonstruct
```

> Why? Because ‚ò†Ô∏è docker

> [!WARNING]
> BIG WIP, dont rely on for any Production needs, yet.

### What it Does:
- Simplifies the process of setting up a Reth node on a Linux system via a shell script.
- This script can:
  - Install: Reth, Lighthouse and Moonstruct.
  - Generate a JWT
  - Run moonsnap to download a snapshot and set up the Reth and Lighthouse daemon services.
  - Produce systemd services to run reth and lighthouse

## Start Here

> Note: Specific to Hetzner dedicated servers

### 0. Prep your ExEx

If you follow the [Reth examples repo](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth-exex-examples/tree/main)

1. top level `Cargo.toml`

```

[workspace]
members = [
  "exex",
  "mock_cl",
]

```

2. ExEx Folder

```

[[bin]]
name = "exex"
path = "bin/exex.rs"

```

This setup should work because the script will find the bin named `exex`, another release may make this configurable

### 1. Install the Repo

1. ssh into your server
2. `git clone https://github.com/AlignNetwork/reth-node-builder.git`
3. (optional) to use moonsnap `-m` place your `MOONSNAP_KEY` in the `.env` from [here](https://github.com/crebsy/moonsnap-downloadoor)
4. `cd reth-node-builder`
5. `chmod +x ./setup.sh`
6. Choose 2a or 2b

### 2a. Setup a full Node

`setup.sh -n <network> -m`

- Installs a Reth Node, Lighthouse CL Node and sets up system d services with moonsnap

### 2b.Setup a Full Node with an ExEx

`setup.sh -s https://github.com/AlignNetwork/blobster.git -m`

- `-s` option is the source of the reth ExEx

### 3. Starting Node

If the script ran successfully you should be able to run:

- `systemctl start reth-<repo_name>-<network>` - Start Reth Client
- `systemctl start lighthouse-<repo_name>-<network>` - Start Lighthouse Client
- `journalctl -u reth-<repo_name>-<network> -f` - Logs of Reth
- `journalctl -u lighthouse-<repo_name>-<network> -f`- Logs of Lighthouse

### Directory Structure:

The setup exists in reth-node-setup and the node data exists in /root/node

```
Directory Structure:
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ node
‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ reth (reth data)
‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ secret (jwt secret)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ reth-node-setup (this script home directory)
‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ node-sources (reth and lighthouse source code)
‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ services (your network services. This is where you put the run commands (reth node etc))
‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .env (Moonsnap environment file)
‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ node_setup.sh (this script)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...

```

### Hosting / ssh

I tested this stack on:

1. Holesky: Hetzner AX42 for Holesky SSD: 2x512 Software: Raid1

> [!TIP]
> I selected Ubunutu 22 base on creation of instance, also added an ssh key with `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "<Email>"`

### Notes:

1. On Hetzner I had interactive menus popup to restart defaults, I proceeded forwarded with them, I haven't looked into what exactly they are but it did not seem to affect the server.
2. Moonsnap saves a lot of time (only took around 2.5 hrs)
